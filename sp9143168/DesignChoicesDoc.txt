Design Choices
==============

1)RMI vs. Serialized objects
  The reason I choose using serialized objects over TCP socket is that I think 
serialized objects over TCP socket is good enough for this application, which 
can be quickly implemented, tested and deployed in this case. 

2)Modifying vs. Extending the Data class
  The main reason I choose to modify the Data class is I'd like to add a 
database service interface and let the Data class implement the interface.
  The database service interface gives a clear interface between database 
server and the client. And writing only the abstraction first helps to 
determine what actions and class relations are necessay on both client and 
server. Actually I used the database service interface as a start point to 
implement the client side and the server side.

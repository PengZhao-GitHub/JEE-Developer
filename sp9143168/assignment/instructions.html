<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="what_this"></A>What This Application is About</H2>
<H3>Background</H3>
<P>Fly By Night Services is a small but growing travel agency that provides flight information on a small selection of routes and carriers. The company's IT department recently had an undergraduate student in for work experience during the summer vacation. This undergraduate did some work using the Java programming language and started to produce a rudimentary database system. </P>
<P>The Information Systems Department Manager now wishes to extend this work into a usable application. This application should keep scheduled flight information for a number of airlines and routes, and it should provide a convenient way to search for and book flights that might suit customer's requirements. This is the project that you have been commissioned to complete. </P>
<H3>The Current Project Status</H3>
<P>At present, a basic data storage and retrieval system (the "database") has been implemented and shown to work by the undergraduate. No network or user level code exists. The database is not relational; it is simply a binary file called "db.db", currently located in the starting/suncertify/db directory of this distribution. This file's format is compatible with the access methods of the Data class. </P>
<H3>What you must do</H3>
<P>The following are the "top level" features that must be implemented: </P>

<UL>
<LI>a graphical user interface for viewing flight information and booking a flight </LI>
<LI>extensions to the database code to support a more flexible search and record locking </LI>
<LI>network server functionality for the database system </LI>
<LI>communications functionality to connect the user interface with the database code </LI></UL>

<H3>How you must do it</H3>
<P>You have been given strict guidelines about the way the work is to be performed. These guidelines are to ensure consistency of marking and to ensure each candidate's workload is comparable. </P>
<P>The work involves a number of design choices that have to be made. In all such cases, the following principles should be applied. </P>
<H4>Clarity and Maintainability.</H4>
<DL>
<DD>A clear design, such as will be readily understood by junior programmers, will be preferred to a complex one, even if the complex one is a little more efficient than the simple choice. However, poor algorithm design where standard solutions are well known will be penalized. </DD>
</DL>
<H4>Documentation.</H4>
<DL>
<DD>The code itself should be as clear as possible, and "obvious" comments should be avoided. Awkward or complex code should have descriptive comments, and javadoc style comments must be used for each element of the public interface of each class. You must create a full suite of documentation for the classes of the completed project, including those that form part of this distribution. This must be achieved using the tool "javadoc" and must be in HTML format. </DD>
<DD>You should also provide basic user documentation. This should be sufficient to allow a user who is familiar with the intent of the project to use the application. If you wish, appropriate parts of the user documentation may be provided on-line. </DD>
</DL>
<H4>Correctness.</H4>
<DL>
<DD>The design used must correctly implement the specified requirements. </DD>
</DL>
<H4>Use of Standard Elements and Design Patterns.</H4>
<DL>
<DD>The design should use standard Java package facilities wherever possible. Designs should not involve building new code if the effect can adequately be achieved using facilities in the standard Java packages. Performance alone is not a justification for ignoring this. </DD>
</DL>

<P><HR></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="arch"></A>Overall Architecture</H2>
<P>Architecturally, the application is a traditional client-server system. There are three key parts: the server-side database with network server functionality, the client-side graphical user interface, and a client-side database client part that handles the networking on behalf of the user interface. </P>
<P>Additionally, the program must be able to work in a non-networked mode. In this mode, the database and user interface run in the same VM and no networking is performed, and no sockets should be created. The user must be able to select the operating mode, although it is acceptable that the program stay in one mode once it has started up. </P>
<P>You have a choice regarding the network connection protocol. You may use either serialized objects over a simple socket connection, or you may use RMI. Your submission will fail automatically if you do not use one of these approaches. </P>
<P>The remote client code that you write must provide all the public methods of the suncertify.db.Data class. </P>
<P><A HREF="instructions.html#top"><EM>Return to top</FONT></EM></A> </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="api_spec"></A>Supplied Code and Required Enhancements</H2>
<P>The classes and code provided to you include some comments, including some in javadoc format. You should refer to these and consider the source itself for a full understanding of the provided code. </P>
<P>The following paragraphs outline the packages that are provided and detail the changes that you must make. </P>
<H3>Deprecated Methods</H3>
<P>In all packages, you should correct any use of deprecated methods. You will need to make some decisions about how to achive this. Consult the section <A HREF="#whattodo">What to do if you have a question</A> which describes how you should approach this situation. </P>
<H3>Target Platform</H3>
<P>Throughout this exercise, you must use exclusively the Java 2 platform. You are not required to develop your code using any particular implementation of the Java 2 platform, but the submission that you return <EM>must have been tested and shown to work under a production (not development) version of the Sun Microsystems' Java 2 platform</EM>. </P>
<B><I><P>Failure to adhere to these directions will result in automatic failure</B></I> </P>
<H3>Execution of Submissions</H3>
<P>Your submission must run under a production (not development) version of Sun's Java 2 Platform. You may develop using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but your final product may not have any residual dependency upon that. </P>
<P>When you submit your assignment, you must ensure that it is packaged in such a way that it is completely clear how the examiner should run it using a <tt>java</tt> command line. Specifically, you should document clear, simple command lines that allow your programs to be run on any Java 2 platform, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system. These command lines may only take configuration parameters selected from this list: </P>

<UL>
<LI>DNS name of the server </LI>
<LI>Port number used by the server </LI>
<LI>Data file name(s) </LI>
<TT><LI>java.rmi.server.codebase</TT> </LI>
<LI>security manager policy file </LI></UL>

<P>You must <EM>not</EM> require the editing of any files by the examiners. </P>
<B><I><P>Failure to adhere to these directions will result in automatic failure</B></I> </P>
<H3>Packaging of Submissions</H3>
<P>All submissions must be packaged in a JAR file. </P>
<B><P>Database Access - Package suncertify.db</B> </P>
<P>Following is a description of the package that is provided, and of the extensions you are expected to implement. </P>
<P>Three classes are in this package: Data, DataInfo, and FieldInfo. With the exception of three methods, noted below, these classes are complete and functional, and you have the source code for them. Any additional classes you create that are related to the database should be placed in the suncertify.db package. The suncertify/db directory in this distribution also contains your database file, "db.db". You may not modify this file, but you may move it if you wish.</P>
<H3>Extending suncertify.db.Data</H3>
<P>Part of your assignment will be to enhance the Data class. You may do this by modification or subclassing, but you should document the approach and reason for your choice. </P>
<P>You are required to implement the <TT>criteriaFind(String)</TT>, <TT>lock(int)</TT> and <TT>unlock(int)</TT> methods: </P>
<B><TT><P>public DataInfo[] criteriaFind(String criteria)</B></TT> </P>
<P>This method searches the database for entries matching the criteria supplied. Criteria take the form of a comma separated list of &lt;field name&gt;=&lt;value to match&gt; specifications. </P>
<P>For example, the following argument string would select all records describing flights by the SpeedyAir carrier that originate in San Francisco. </P>
<TT><P>"Carrier='SpeedyAir',Origin='SFO'"</TT> </P>
<P>Note that only exact matches need to be handled in this <TT>criteriaFind(String)</TT> method. </P>
<P>The method returns an array of DataInfo objects describing all the records found in the database which match these criteria. In the event of an invalid field name being provided as part of the criteria the behavior of this method is the same as if no records matched correctly specified criteria. </P>
<B><TT><P>public void lock(int record)</B></TT> </P>
<B><TT><P>public void unlock(int record)</B></TT> </P>
<P>Record locking must be implemented using the methods <TT>public void lock(int)</TT> and <TT>public void unlock(int)</TT>. These methods are required to allow concurrent use of the database when booking flights from multiple clients. Note that the locking required is effectively a "write" lock only. If updates occur to a record that is being displayed on another client, then no change occurs at the other client. However, if two clients attempt to perform the sequence lock, read, modify, write, unlock concurrently, then both modification attempts will be handled correctly. The aim is to ensure that if two customers attempt to book a seat on the same flight concurrently, then the number of available seats is definitely reduced by two, unless there was only one seat, in which case, one customer will be advised at booking time that no more seats are available. </P>
<P>The <TT>lock</TT> method should block until the requested lock can be applied. The integer argument indicates the record to be locked. If the method is called with an argument of -1, the entire database should be locked.</P>
<P>The <TT>unlock</TT> method simply removes the lock from the specified record. If an attempt is made to unlock a record that has not been locked by this connection, then no action is be taken. </P>
<H3>Writing the Data Server</H3>
<P>You must create a data server that will accept multiple concurrent network connections and allow them to interrogate and manipulate the database. Because multiple concurrent connections may exist, you must make both your server and the suncertify.db classes threadsafe. You may implement your threaded server in more than one class if you choose. </P>
<H3>Writing Data Client</H3>
<P>To connect with your server, you should create a client program. This implementation should include a class that implements the same public methods as the suncertify.db.Data class, although it will need different constructors to allow it to support the network configuration. </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UI"></A>Creating the user interface </H2>
<P>The user interface for this assignment must satisfy the following criteria: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Only components from the Java Foundation Classes (Swing components) should be used. </LI>
<LI>The main data output section of the user interface should be created using a JTable. </LI>
<LI>The user interface should connect to the database using either a local or a network based connection according to user choice. </LI>
<LI>The user should be able to select the origin and destination of flights, and the display should update to show only flights that satisfy those criteria. The user must be able to describe enter the string value "any" for the origin, destination, or both, so as to implement a wildcard-like feature. </LI>
<LI>The user must be able to book one or more seats on a chosen flight. If the flight cannot provide those seats, the user must be informed. It is not necessary to provide for live updates on multiple clients when new bookings are made at other clients. </LI></UL>

<P>Your user interface should be designed with the expectation of future functionality enhancements, and it should establish a control scheme that will support this with minimal disruption to the users when this occurs. </P>
<P><A HREF="instructions.html#top"><EM>Return to top</FONT></EM></A> </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="net_protocol"></A>Network Approaches </H2>
<P>You may choose between using RMI, or using serialized objects over TCP socket connections, to implement the database network communication. Your choice here will not affect your grade, but no other approach is acceptable. In either case, the program must allow the user to specify the location of the database, and it must also accept an indication that a local database is to be used, in which case, the networking must be bypassed entirely. No authentication is required for database access. </P>
<P>You may implement such classes as you need in order to support this network protocol. The classes should be in appropriate packages and source files, and each method should be documented according to the general guidelines. </P>
<P><A HREF="instructions.html#top"><EM>Return to top</FONT></EM></A> </P>
<P><HR></P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="Deliverables"></A>Deliverables </H2>
<P>When you submit your assignment, you should provide the following parts. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Full source and object code, including new classes, modified versions of supplied classes, and copies of supplied classes that were not modified. These should be in an appropriate directory structure along with the classfiles. You may use JAR files to contain groups of elements of your submission as you deem appropriate, for example, to support the execution of your programs. </LI>
<LI>Database file db.db. </LI>
<LI>Full documentation. You must provide HTML/Javadoc documentation for all classes, whether supplied, modified, or new. Also provide user documentation for the database server and the gui client. As noted earlier, your user documentation may be online if you wish, but there must be one file in the root directory of your submission called README.txt, as described below. Also provide a file that documents your major design choices and the reasons for those choices. Include your choice of RMI vs. Serialized objects, and modifying vs. Extending the Data class. </LI>
<LI>A README.txt file. You <EM>must</EM> create a single text file (plain ASCII format; word processor formats are unacceptable) called README.txt that describes to the examiner the following information in exactly the order listed: </LI>

<UL>
<LI>The exact version of JDK you used, including the platform you worked on.
<LI>How to execute the programs. You must provide exact command-line instructions. If any environmental setup is required, do not just say what needs to be done; provide instructions on how to perform the setup. For example, do not say something like "add server.jar to your classpath". You should document exactly how to add the jar file to the classpath. Note: your program must run correctly no matter what directory it is installed in. </LI>
<LI>The location of your db.db file. </LI>
<LI>The location of your Design Choices document. </LI>
<LI>The names of the files you have submitted, with a note of their location in the directory structure, and a high level description of the purpose of each. </LI></UL>
</UL>

<P>All elements of your submission must be packaged into a single JAR file for submission. It is permitted to nest JAR files inside the main JAR. </P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="marking"></A>Marking </H2>
<P>This section describes how your submission will be marked, and the marking criteria which govern allocation of marks for the Sun Certified Developer for the Java 2 platform application submission. The first part describes the marking process, and the second describes how the marks are allocated. </P>
<P>The first describes general criteria which are expected to apply to all parts of the submission. The second part is divided into three sections which describe considerations that are specific to the three main tasks in the requirements: the user interface, the network connection, and the database search facility. </P>
<B><P>How The Assignment is Marked </P>
</B><P>The marking is done is two phases. First, the examiner runs the code, ensuring that it functions correctly through the specified operations. </P>
<P>Provided the essential behavioral requirements of the assignment have been correctly implemented, the examiner proceeds to investigate the design and implementation of your assignment. This process is time consuming, and it is because this is done carefully and thoroughly that submissions take time to grade. The grading process is closely controlled to ensure consistency and fairness, and it is performed according to criteria detailed in the next section. </P>
<P>In addition to the submission, you will be required to take a written examination. This exam tests your understanding of your submission and asks you to justify a number of design choices embodied in that submission. For any design choice concerning topics not specifically described in the requirements, marks are awarded for a clear and consistent approach, rather than for any particular solution. <B>Design decisions should be <I>briefly but clearly</I> described in your comments.</B> </P>
<B><P>Marking Criteria </P>
</B><P>The following marking criteria are given as a guide. The numbers in parentheses beside each topic indicate the relative proportion of marks available in that area (note that they do not add up to 100, and hence are not percentages). Some of these criteria, especially the ones in "General Considerations," apply in more than one place, and as such might appear to show a disproportionate score. In some cases, a topic shows a few notes to elaborate on the meaning of the heading. </P>

<P><HR></P>
<H2><A NAME="whattodo">What to do if you have a question</A></H2>
<P>You may find that you want to ask for further explanation of some part of these notes, perhaps to seek permission to solve a problem in a particular way. These notes deliberately leave some issues unspecified, and some problems unraised. Your ability to think through these issues, in the face of realistically imperfect specifications, and come to a tenable solution is something upon which you are being graded. </P>
<P>You should consider the options available and make a decision about how to address the problem yourself. This decision making process is part of the marking scheme, and as such it is crucially important that you provide documentation of your choice. Be sure to describe the options you considered, the perceived benefits and weaknesses of each, and why you chose the solution you did. You will not be marked on the choice that you made, but rather on the consistency of your decision making process and your adherence to other aspects of these notes during that decision making process. </P>
